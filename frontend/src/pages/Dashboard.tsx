        For me, it's the McChicken. The best fast food sandwich. I even ask for extra McChicken
        sauce packets and the staff is so friendly and more than willing to oblige. One time I asked
        for McChicken sauce packets and they gave me three. I said, "Wow, three for free!" and the
        nice friendly McDonald's worker laughed and said, "I'm going to call you 3-for-free!". Now
        the staff greets me with "hey it's 3-for-free!" and ALWAYS give me three packets. It's such
        a fun and cool atmosphere at my local McDonald's restaurant, I go there at least 3 times a
        week for lunch and a large iced coffee with milk instead of cream, 1-2 times for breakfast
        on the weekend, and maybe once for dinner when I'm in a rush but want a great meal that is
        affordable, fast, and can match my daily nutritional needs. I even dip my fries in McChicken
        sauce, it's delicious! What a great restaurant.

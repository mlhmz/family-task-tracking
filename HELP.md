When you've selected your `ftt-realm.json`, which is located in the Projects Root Directory, the fields will be filled,
and you can finally click on `Create`.

After these steps your realm is created! 

### Add user
You still need a user in order to access the api and use the client.  
This time you have to navigate to the `Users`-Tab and Click on `Add user`.

After you've created a user, you need credentials (a password).  
For that, click on the user in the user list, click on the `Credentials`-Tab and click on `Set password`

Set a password that you like, disable the `Temporary`-Checkbox (Important! Otherwise, the user won't be activated)
and click on set Password.
